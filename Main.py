# @brief:
#  Main python file of PySQUID
# @to-do:
#  Should make improvements on Bi-SQUID voltage response visualization. Visualization of
#  voltage response is not smooth due to differential equations solver algorithm.(i think)
#  You should run this simulator and see what is best !!! :)
#  You should fix Bi-SQUID period problem !!!
#  You should create clasesses for output data generation and visualization !!!
#  You should start to generate graphical user interface !!!
#  You should integrate SQUID classes into the PySQUID project. (problem is Bi-SQUID time
#  based and SQUID is static, you can do SQUID as time based and you can use same classes
#  for both SQUID and Bi-SQUID.)
#  you should change data points as magnetic field sampling !!!
# initial conditions kısmını user a sormasan olur ne anlasın user :D/ aynı şekilde time ve
# magnetic field resolution !!!Bunlar optional inputlar olabilir default değerler girersin
# kullanıcıdan optional alrısın !!!
# netlsit şekiklde kullanıcıdan input alsın !!!
# @bugs: There is no known bugs.
