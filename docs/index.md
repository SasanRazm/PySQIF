# About 

PySQUID is an open-source and user-friendly statistical analysis library for  SQUIDs/Bi-SQUIDs. Our library solves Bi-SQUID systems of differential equations. Our methodology is based on finding the voltage response of the Bi-SQUID for each time steps in the period. PySQUID library gives the average voltage response of symmetric Bi-SQUID for each corresponding normalized applied external magnetic flux as an output. The normalized applied external magnetic flux range can be determined by the user. Moreover, PySQUID provides multiple runs for the statistical analysis of Bi-SQUID. Users can determine margin and data range for one of the input parameters, and the tool generates gaussian distributed random numbers in a specific margin and data range for the said parameter. After that, the voltage response in an external applied magnetic field is achieved in the defined margin. These output sets, provide a wide range of design options to the user who can easily observe a reliable working range of Bi-SQUID circuits and can optimize Bi-SQUID design problems by using this output dataset.

## Input Text File
 PySQUID has an input csv file for input protocol with user, this file is named as input.csv in PySQUID folder. Figure shows below input parameters of this simulation in input csv file, which can be edited by user.

"input.csv" file has two columns, "circuit_parameters" columns represents Bi-SQUID circuit elements, and "values" columns represents mathematical value of these circuit elements. Figure shows below Bi-SQUID circuit representation:

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tBkg38y/bisquid.png" alt="bisquid" border="0"></a>

- l1a, and l1b represents inductances at top of circuit.
- l2a, and l2b represents inductances at parallel third Josephson Junction.
- l3a, and l3b repesents inductances at bottom of circuit.

## Requirements

PySQUID depends on several open-source libraries. The following packages are currently required:

- scipy
- numpy
- Solver
- matplotlib
- statistics
- pandas
