## Input Text File
 PySQUID has an input csv file for input protocol with user, this file is named as input.csv in PySQUID folder. Figure shows below input parameters of this simulation in input csv file, which can be edited by user.

"input.csv" file has two columns, "circuit_parameters" columns represents Bi-SQUID circuit elements, and "values" columns represents mathematical value of these circuit elements. Figure shows below Bi-SQUID circuit representation:

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tBkg38y/bisquid.png" alt="bisquid" border="0"></a>

- l1a, and l1b represents inductances at top of circuit.
- l2a, and l2b represents inductances at parallel third Josephson Junction.
- l3a, and l3b repesents inductances at bottom of circuit.

## Requirements

PySQUID depends on several open-source libraries. The following packages are currently required:

- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statistics
- pandas

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aakgn/PySQUID/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aakgn/PySQUID/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.
