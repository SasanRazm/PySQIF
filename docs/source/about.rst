Today, DC SQUIDs are extensively used in commercially applications as sensitive magnetometers such as 
microscopy, readout electronics, nondestructive test, biomagnetism applications. [1]DC SQUID’s voltage 
response against external applied magnetic field is non-linear, this situation may cause difficulties in application
and limit the dynamic range of sensor. As a result, researchers tend to investigate DC SQUID based circuits, 
which is more linear than conventional DC SQUIDs (Bi-SQUID, arrays of SQUIDs, …, etc.). Bi-SQUID is one
of the alternative solutions. Instead of the conventional DC SQUID, Bi-SQUID is designed by adding a parallel 
Josephson junction to typical DC SQUID. Bi-SQUID ‘s voltage response against external applied magnetic field
is more linear than DC SQUID. [2], [3]
