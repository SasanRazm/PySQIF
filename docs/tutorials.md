## Input Text File
 SQUIDpy has an input csv file for input protocol with user, this file is named as input.csv in SQUIDpy folder. Figure shows below input parameters of this simulation in input csv file, which can be edited by user.

"input.csv" file has two columns, "circuit_parameters" columns represents Bi-SQUID circuit elements, and "values" columns represents mathematical value of these circuit elements. Figure shows below Bi-SQUID circuit representation:

- l1a, and l1b represents inductances at top of circuit.
- l2a, and l2b represents inductances at parallel third Josephson Junction.
- l3a, and l3b repesents inductances at bottom of circuit.
